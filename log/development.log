<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>A post-commit hook is basically a piece of information that can be sent to a third party software service to notify and/or trigger an event at their end. A simple case use I am going to explain would be sending a message to a Campfire chat room every time a new record is created. Remember, a record can be anything you want i.e. a blog post or a new medical record. It just depends on what your Rails application actually does.</p>

    27: <p>A post-commit hook is basically a piece of information that can be sent to a third party software service to notify and/or trigger an event at their end. A simple case use I am going to explain would be sending a message to a Campfire chat room every time a new record is created. Remember, a record can be anything you want i.e. a blog post or a new medical record. It just depends on what your Rails application actually does.</p>
